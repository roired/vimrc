Vim .vimrc configuration file


For Silverblue:
  add the file directly on the Home folder
  
For Haiku:
  - create a folder named 'vim' in /boot/home/config/settings
  - add the file without the '.' inside that folder: /boot/home/config/settings/vim/vimrc
  - Note: careful with plugins> should setup plugin managers with the right paths before attempting to install any plugin
